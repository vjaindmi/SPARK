        	You can access and download the text of this Agreement online at [Link#01].
        </div>
    </div>
    <strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Remuneration</strong>
    <div id="bodyInfo">

        </div>
        <label id="bodyInfoExtension">2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecommunication Costs</label>
        <div id="bodyInfo">
        	The use of certain functions of the One-Key App requires an internet connection of the device (e.g. smartphone) on which the One-Key App is installed (“Device”). This may cause costs for data traffic according to Your agreement with Your network operator. Such costs are to be borne by You.
        </div>
    </div>    
    <strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-Key App Functionality</strong>
    <div id="bodyInfo">
         <label id="bodyInfoExtension">3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Functions</label>
        <div id="bodyInfo">
        	The One-Key App provides functions for tool control (see clause 3.2), inventory management (see clause 3.3) and tool reporting (see clause 3.4) in connection with certain Milwaukee tools and equipment that is One-Key ready (“One-Key Tool”).
        </div>
        <label id="bodyInfoExtension">3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Tool Control</label>
        <div id="bodyInfo">
        	The One-Key App allows to set certain parameters in One-Key Tools, e.g. the speed or torque of a drill. Commands are sent by the Device to the One-Key Tool via a wireless Bluetooth connection. Please refer to the manual of Your tool to find out if and to what extent it can be used in connection with the One-Key App. The tool control functionality of the One-Key App can be used as a stand-alone function, i.e. without using the inventory management system or tool reporting.
        </div>
        <label id="bodyInfoExtension">3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventory Management System</label>
        <div id="bodyInfo">
        	The One-Key App contains inventory management functions (i) to create an inventory of One-Key Tools and third party tools, and (ii) to gather and manage information about the usage of such tools and to create respective reports. These functions are provided by the One-Key App, however certain functions may only be available in connection with an online inventory management platform (website) (“Inventory Management Platform”). If You use the inventory management functions, the One-Key App will automatically collect from registered One-Key Tools certain data (e.g. serial number, use history) via Bluetooth, store such data and send it via an internet connection of the Device (if available) to the server of the Inventory Management Platform (“One-Key Server”). <br />
        	This Agreement does not cover the use of the Inventory Management Platform (website). For the terms and conditions of the Inventory Management Platform please see [Link#02]. We reserve the right to cancel the connectivity of the One-Key App to the One-Key Server at any time and do not owe a specific availability of the One-Key Server. 
        </div>
        <label id="bodyInfoExtension">3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Tool Reporting</label>
        <div id="bodyInfo">

        </div>
        <label id="bodyInfoExtension">3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Online Registration</label>
        <div id="bodyInfo">
        	In order to use the One-Key App You have to create an online account (“One-Key Account”). Such registration requires an internet connection and can be accomplished within the One-Key App. In order to use the One-Key App in connection with a specific One-Key Tool, the One-Key Tool (ID) must be linked with Your One-Key Account.

It may also be necessary to install an update in order to ensure interoperability of the One-Key App with future versions of the Inventory Management Platform or future One-Key Tools.
